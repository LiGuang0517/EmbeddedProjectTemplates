# LVGLSimulator

Implemented LVGL Simulator in CLion, and here is the corresponding blog link:

[How to implement the LVGL simulator in CLion ?](LVGLSimulator/How%20to%20implement%20the%20LVGL%20simulator%20in%20CLion.md)

# BootLoader_Application

Here is specfic documentation for this project:
[How to implement STM32H750VBT6's Bootloader in CLion?](BootLoader_Application/How%20to%20implement%20Bootloader%20on%20STM32H750VBT6%20in%20CLion.md)

It took a lot of time and experience to realize this Bootloader, but I still feel very happy that is was successfully completed in the end.

# ExFlashLVGL

This project implements downloading LVGL to external Flash.

# InternalFlash

Write a program to measure and verify the internal Flash size of STM32H750VBT6. My development board is 1024KB, if it exceeds this range, it will enter HardFault_Handler.

Here is a documentation in the project file:
[How to measure the internal flash size and verify it?](InternalFlash/How%20to%20measure%20the%20internal%20flash%20size%20and%20verify%20it.md)
