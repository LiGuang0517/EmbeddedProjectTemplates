# About

I need to use the DSP library, and while exploring options, I discovered that the latest version available in STM32CubeMX is 1.3.However, the most recent version on Github is 1.14.And the most important is version 1. of the DSP library lacks windowing functions compared to version 1.14 of the library.

In conclusion, I decided to port it as a template.

# Step

1. Using STM32CubeMX to configure your projectï¼Œsuch as my project named `STM32_DSP_Library`

2. Downlaod the latest [DSP library](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-DSP) into yourself project

3. Change the file of `STM32_DSP_Library/CMakeLists.txt`
    - Define the `CMSISCORE` variable.This variable indicates the path to the `Drivers/CMSIS/` folder under the current project.It is required for the `CMSIS-DSP/Source/CMakeLists.txt` file.The 'CMSIS-DSP' library uses some header files from the `Drivers/CMSIS/Include` folder generated by STM32CubeMX.
      ```cmake
      set(CMSISCORE "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/Drivers/CMSIS/")
      add_subdirectory(CMSIS-DSP/Source bin_dsp)
      ```
    - Link CMSIS-DSP to your project.After adding your executable using `add_executable`, link the `CMSISDSP` library to `${PROJECT_NAME}.elf`. This enables you to use the CMSIS-DSP APIs in your project. 
      ```cmake
      add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}.elf ${SOURCES} ${LINKER_SCRIPT})
      target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}.elf PUBLIC CMSISDSP)
      ```
4. Test and compile the project.Test the relevant functions from the CMSIS-DAP library and compile the project using CMake.
